## Welcome
Welcome to the GitHub profile of Ashutosh Mukherjee aka `average-engineer`. This profile is an attempt by me to document all the work I have been (and will be) a part of in my career. Since this is GitHub, naturally I can include only the projects that have some *coding* within them. Additionally, most of the active repositories are works in progress and not necessarily presentable.

I maintain more thorough and perhaps formal documentation of my work on my [website](https://average-engineer.github.io/Projects-Website-Ashutosh-Mukherjee/).
